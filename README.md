    <h1>Next 13 - Template</h1>
    <p>Creating a repository template on GitHub is a very useful practice for standardizing the structure and settings of your projects. With this, you can define a set of files, folders, and settings that will be automatically applied to all new repositories created from your template.
    </p>
<p>
This is especially useful when it comes to establishing quality standards and best development practices, such as code and commit linting, folder organization, etc. By defining these standards in your template, you ensure that all your projects have a minimum level of quality and organization, and make it easier to collaborate between different projects within your team.

The official GitHub documentation on repository templates can be found at the following link: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template" target="_blank">Github - Template Repository</a>.</p>

<h1>Next 13</h1>
